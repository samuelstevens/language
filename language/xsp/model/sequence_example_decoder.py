    """A decoder for TensorFlow Examples.

  Decoding Example proto buffers is comprised of two stages: (1) Example parsing
  and (2) tensor manipulation.
  In the first stage, the tf.parse_example function is called with a list of
  FixedLenFeatures and SparseLenFeatures. These instances tell TF how to parse
  the example. The output of this stage is a set of tensors.
  In the second stage, the resulting tensors are manipulated to provide the
  requested 'item' tensors.
  To perform this decoding operation, an ExampleDecoder is given a list of
  ItemHandlers. Each ItemHandler indicates the set of features for stage 1 and
  contains the instructions for post_processing its tensors for stage 2.
